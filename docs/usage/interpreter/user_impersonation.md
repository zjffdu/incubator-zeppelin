# Impersonation

User impersonation enables to run zeppelin interpreter process as the login user

## Setup

#### 1. Enable Shiro auth in `conf/shiro.ini`

```
[users]
user1 = password1, role1
user2 = password2, role2
```

#### 2. Make sure you have the user account in the zeppelin server host (say user1). And these user are in the same group with user who start zeppelin server.

```bash
adduser user1
```

Alternatively instead of password-less, user can override ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_CMD in zeppelin-env.sh

```bash
export ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_CMD='sudo -H -u ${ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_USER} bash -c '
```

#### 3. Build execute-as-user

* mvn compile -Pnative ...
* run: chown root ZEPPELIN_HOME/bin/execute-as-user (you might need root privilege)
* run: chmod 6050 ZEPPELIN_HOME/bin/execute-as-user (you might need root privilege)

#### 4. Restart zeppelin server.

```bash
# for OSX, linux
bin/zeppelin-daemon restart

# for windows
bin\zeppelin.cmd
```

#### 5. Configure impersonation for interpreter 

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12" >
      <a data-lightbox="compiler" href="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/screenshots/user-impersonation.gif">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/screenshots/user-impersonation.gif" />
      </a>
  </div>
</div>

<br/>

Go to interpreter setting page, and enable "User Impersonate" in any of the interpreter (in my example its shell interpreter)

#### 6. Test with a simple paragraph

```bash
%sh
whoami
```

```
%spark
println(System.getenv("HOME"))
```

```
%python
from os.path import expanduser
print(expanduser("~"))
```
Note that usage of "User Impersonate" option will enable Spark interpreter to use `--proxy-user` option with current user by default. If you want to disable `--proxy-user` option, then refer to `ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_SPARK_PROXY_USER` variable in `conf/zeppelin-env.sh`
